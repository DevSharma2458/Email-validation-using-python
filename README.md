# Email-validation-using-python
The "Email Validation Using Python" script is designed to efficiently determine the validity of email addresses. 
The code leverages regular expressions (regex) to match email addresses against a predefined pattern, ensuring they conform to standard email format rules.
It checks for the presence of essential components such as the '@' symbol, domain name, and top-level domain (TLD). 
By utilizing Python's powerful re module, the script can quickly and accurately validate large lists of email addresses, making it a valuable tool for applications requiring user registration, data cleaning, or email verification.
